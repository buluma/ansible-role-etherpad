## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-etherpad/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- become: true
  gather_facts: true
  hosts: all
  name: Converge
  roles:
    - role: buluma.etherpad
  vars:
    etherpad_port: 9002
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-etherpad/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- become: true
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: all
  name: Prepare
  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.npm
```
